## MCP Servers

- **DeepWiki** - AI-powered documentation for any GitHub repository
- **Exa** - Web search and code context retrieval

## Databricks CLI

The Databricks CLI is pre-configured with your credentials. Test it:
```bash
databricks current-user me
```

Databricks can only authenticate with a PAT or CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET pair. If you have trouble logging in, remove the CLIENT_SECRET and CLIENT_ID from your environment, then try again. We want access to only be based on the app owner's credentials.

Common commands:
```bash
databricks workspace list /Workspace/Users/
databricks jobs list
databricks clusters list
```

## Project Setup

Before starting any new project or documentation:

1. **Always initialize a git repo first:**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-project && cd my-project
   git init
   ```
   Or clone an existing repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```

2. **Why?** Git commits automatically sync your work to Databricks Workspace at `/Workspace/Users/{your-email}/projects/{project-name}/`

3. **Then start working** - your commits will be backed up to Workspace

## Quick Start

- Projects sync to Databricks Workspace on git commit
- Use `/commit` for guided commits
- Ask "help me create a dashboard" to see skills in action
- Ask about any GitHub repo with DeepWiki MCP

# things to remember
Remember to never move .git folder to the workspace if you're running workspace import.
